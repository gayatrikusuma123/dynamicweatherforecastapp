=> What Is a Weather API?

A Weather API (Application Programming Interface) is a web service that provide weather data to developers and businesses. These APIs provide their users with data from official weather sources. Moreover, weather APIs usually provide data to their users with API keys.

There are some features that a good weather API should have. Some of those:

=> Rich Weather Data: A good weather API should provide its users with basic weather information (temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation, sunny/cloudy, etc.).

=> Up-to-date Weather Data: This API should provide the most up-to-date weather data possible.

=> Forecasts and Future Data: Another feature that makes a weather API popular is that it provides forecast data. These forecasts can help users plan or make decisions based on the weather.

=> Wide Location Support: A good weather API should provide rich location support to its users. Many users in the global age should also be able to use this API.

=> Stability and Reliability: It is very important for a weather API to have high uptime and the accuracy of the data it provides.

# Features

=> Weather Display Section: Upon successful retrieval of weather data, the application displays various weather parameters including temperature, weather description, location, feels-like temperature, and humidity.

=> Dynamic Weather Icon: The application dynamically changes the weather icon based on the weather condition fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API.

=> Error Handling: The app handles errors gracefully, such as invalid city names or API failures, and provides appropriate error messages to the user.

=> Responsive Design: The application is responsive and adapts well to different screen sizes and devices.

# Dependencies

The Weather Forecast App relies on the following dependencies:

=> OpenWeatherMap API: Used to fetch weather data based on the provided city name or geographical coordinates.

=> Google Fonts API: Imported Google Fonts for styling text content within the application.

# Technologies Used

The Weather Forecast App is built using the following technologies:

To build this app, I used the classic trio of web development - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

The front-end was crafted using HTML for the structure, CSS for the styling, and JavaScript to handle the interactivity and data retrieval.

# HTML5: Used for creating the structure of the web page.

This documentation provides a clear explanation of the structure and functionality of the Weather Forecast App HTML code.

=> Structure Overview

The HTML code consists of the following main sections:

~ Wrapper: This is the main container for the entire Weather Forecast App.

~ Header Section: Displays the title of the application, which is "Weather Forecast App". It also includes a left arrow icon for navigation purposes.

~ Input Section: Allows users to input a city name or retrieve the device's location for weather information.

~ Weather Information Section: Displays weather information such as weather icon, temperature, weather description, location, and additional weather details.

=> Detailed Description

~ Header Section: The header section contains the title of the application, "Weather Forecast App", followed by a left arrow icon, which is implemented using the <i> element with the class bx-left-arrow-alt.

~ Input Section: The input section consists of an input field for entering a city name and a button to get the device's location.

The input field has the following attributes:

~ type="text": Specifies that the input should accept text input.

~ spellcheck="false": Disables spell checking for the input field.

~ placeholder="Enter city name": Displays a placeholder text inside the input field.

~ required: Specifies that the input field is required before submitting the form.

~ The button to get the device's location does not have any specific attributes or classes.

=> Weather Information Section

The weather information section displays various weather-related details, including weather icon, temperature, weather description, location, and additional weather details.

~ Weather Icon: An <img> element is used to display the weather icon. The src attribute is empty, indicating that it will be populated dynamically with the appropriate weather icon.

~ Temperature: Temperature is displayed using a <span> element with the class temp. The temperature value is represented by a <span> element with the class numb, followed by a degree symbol (°), and the unit Celsius (C).

~ Location Display: The location display includes an icon (represented by the <i> element with the class bx-map) and the location coordinates represented by a <span> element.

~ Additional Weather Details: This section includes two columns for displaying additional weather details such as "Feels like" temperature and humidity.

~ Feels Like Temperature: Displays the "feels like" temperature using the <div> element with the class feels. It includes a thermometer icon (represented by the <i> element with the class bxs-thermometer) and the temperature value.

~ Humidity: Displays the humidity using the <div> element with the class humidity. It includes a droplet icon (represented by the <i> element with the class bxs-droplet-half) and the humidity value.

# CSS3: Styled the user interface and applied responsive design principles.

=> JavaScript (ES6+): Implemented interactivity and dynamic content updates, including fetching data from the API and handling user input.

# External Libraries

The Weather Forecast App uses the following external libraries:

=> Google Fonts: Imported the "Poppins" font family from Google Fonts for consistent typography across the application.

f. Code Structure

The codebase of the Weather Forecast App is organized into three main components:

=> HTML Structure: Defines the layout and structure of the web page using HTML5 elements such as <header>, <section>, and <div>.

=> CSS Styling: Styles the various elements of the application, including fonts, colors, borders, and layout, to create an appealing user interface.

=> JavaScript Interactivity: Implements dynamic behavior and functionality, including handling user input, fetching data from the API, updating the UI, and error handling.

g. Usage

To use the Weather Forecast App, follow these steps:

=> Open the web page in a supported web browser.

=> Enter the name of the city for which you want to retrieve weather information in the input field.

=> Press the "Enter" key or click the "Get Device Location" button to fetch weather data.

=> Upon successful retrieval, the weather information will be displayed in the designated section of the page.

=> If an error occurs during the process, an appropriate error message will be displayed to the user.

h. Detailed Functionality

=> Input Handling

The app listens for user input in the city name input field.

When the user presses the "Enter" key, it triggers a function to fetch weather data for the entered city.

If the input field is empty, no action is taken.

=> Geolocation Feature

Clicking the "Get Device Location" button triggers a function to fetch weather data based on the user's current geographical location.

The browser's geolocation API is used to retrieve the latitude and longitude coordinates of the user's device.

Weather data is fetched using these coordinates.

=> Fetching Weather Data

The app constructs the API request URL with the provided city name or geographical coordinates and the OpenWeatherMap API key.

It then sends an HTTP request to the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data.

Upon receiving a response, it parses the JSON data and extracts relevant weather information.

=> Displaying Weather Information

If the API request is successful and weather data is retrieved, the app updates the UI to display the weather information.

This includes updating the weather icon, temperature, weather description, location, feels-like temperature, and humidity.

The weather icon changes dynamically based on the weather condition fetched from the API.

=> Error Handling

If the API request fails or returns an error response, the app displays an appropriate error message to the user.

Error messages include notifying the user of invalid city names or API errors.

Error messages are styled differently to distinguish them from regular informational messages.

i. Future Improvements

To enhance the Weather Forecast App, consider implementing the following improvements:

=> Additional Weather Parameters: Display more detailed weather information such as wind speed, atmospheric pressure, and visibility.

=> Unit Conversion: Allow users to toggle between different units for temperature (e.g., Celsius and Fahrenheit) and other weather parameters.

=> Enhanced User Interface: Improve the visual design and layout of the application for a more intuitive and engaging user experience.

=> Geolocation Permission Handling: Provide better handling for geolocation permissions and user consent, especially on mobile devices.

j. Conclusion
